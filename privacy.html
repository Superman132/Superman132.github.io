                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Timetable:BHS&#8217;s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.</p>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>

<p>New Timetable:BHS accounts are created anonymously, without email addresses or passwords.</p>

<p>We store information about your class, schedule, and grades on your device. No information is stored on the server</p>

<h3><strong>Technical basics</strong></h3>

<p>If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We <strong>never</strong> use notifications for marketing.</p>

<p>If you upload files to Timetable:BHS, we need to store them until you delete them.</p>

<h2>Information usage</h2>

<p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.</p>

<p>We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Timetable:BHS&#8217;s functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people listen to a particular podcast with Overcast.</p>

<p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p>

<p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. Passwords are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hashed</a>, not stored, using industry-standard methods (currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a>).</p>

<h2>Accessing, changing, or deleting information</h2>

<p>You may access or change your information or delete your account by deleting the Timetable:BHS app.</p>

<p>Overcast may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.</p>

<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

<p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.</p>

<h2>Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

<p>We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

<h2>Information for European Union Customers</h2>

<p>By using Timetable:BHS and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.</p>

<h2>International Transfers of Information</h2>

<p>Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.</p>

<h2>Your Consent</h2>

<p>By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Contacting Us</h2>

<p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email <a href="mailto:yash.gupta7782@gmail.com">yash.gupta7782@gmail.com</a>. Please note that account deletion should be done by deleting the Timetable app, not via email requests, for security reasons.</p>
